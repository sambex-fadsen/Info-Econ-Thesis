### 3 Reasonable Demands

Let's start with some definitions. Given $n$ voters $\{x_1,x_2...,x_n\}$ and $m$ candidates $\{y_1,y_2...,y_m\}$, we define $\mathcal{O}$ to be the set of all $m!$ _order preferences_ over our candidates. 

A _preference profile_ is an element $\theta \in \mathcal{O}^n$, where we let $\theta_i$ be the order preference of the $i$th voter. In particular, we write $\theta_i(a) \succ \theta_i(b)$ if voter $x_i$ prefers candidate $y_a$ to candidate $y_b$.

Finally, a _social aggregation function_ is any function $f: \mathcal{O}^n \to \mathcal{O}$ which maps a given preference profile to a unique order preference (you can think of this as our 'voting system').

Now, we are ready to describe the 3 demands we want our social aggregation function $f$ to satisfy. I will define each demand formally and then use plain English to make each one seem reasonable.

First, $f$ satisfies _unanimity_ iff $\forall \theta \in \mathcal{O}^n$:
$$(\forall i \in [n], \ \theta_i(a) \succ \theta_i(b)) \implies  f(\theta)(a) \succ f(\theta)(b)$$
This means if each of our voters prefers $y_a$ to $y_b$, then the aggregate preference must also favor $y_a$ to $y_b$.

Second, $f$ satisfies _binary independence_ iff $\forall \theta,\tau \in \mathcal{O}^n$:
$$(\forall i \in [n], \ \theta_i(a) \succ \theta_i(b) \leftrightarrow \tau_i(a) \succ \tau_j(b)) \implies (f(\theta)(a) \succ f(\theta)(b) \leftrightarrow f(\tau)(a) \succ f(\tau)(b) )$$
In other words, the aggregate preference between $y_a$ and $y_b$ is uniquely determined by each voter's preference between $y_a$ and $y_b$.

Third, $f$ satisfies _non-dictatorship_ iff:
$$\neg(\exists i \in [n] \ \text{s.t.} \ \forall \theta \in \mathcal{O}, \ f(\theta)=\theta_i)$$
That is to say, there does not exist a voter whose order preference is _always_ the aggregate preference.

Hopefully, these demands seem like sensible things to ask from a voting system. If they don't, maybe try convincing yourself that a simple majority rule procedure between two candidates _does_ satisfy them.

Unfortunately, when there are more than $2$ candidates, turns out we're asking for too much...

### Proof of the Theorem
STAC there exists a social aggregation function $f$ satisfying unanimity, binary independence, and non-dictatorship in an election with more than 2 candidates...

#### Defining Pivots
Given two candidates $y_a$, $y_b$, we define the _pivot_ from $a$ to $b$ as follows.

Consider a preference profile $\theta^0 \in \mathcal{O}^n$ where $\forall i \in [n]$:
$$\theta^0_i(a) \succ \theta^0_i(b)$$
By unanimity, we must have:
$$f(\theta^0)(a) \succ f(\theta^0)(b)$$
Now pick $\theta^{k} \in \mathcal{O}^n$ so that $\forall i \in [n]\backslash [k]$:
$$\theta^{k}_i(a) \succ \theta^{k}_i(b)$$
but $\forall i \in [k]$:
$$\theta_i^{k}(a) \prec \theta_i^{k}(b) $$
In particular, the last preference profile $\theta^n$ will have $\forall i \in [n]$:
$$\theta^n_i(a) \prec \theta^n_i(b)$$
Thus by unanimity, we must have:
$$f(\theta^n)(a) \prec f(\theta^n)(b)$$
Moreover, we are guarenteed the existence of an integer $b|a \in [n]$ satisfying:
$$b|a=\min\{k \ | \ f(\theta^k)(a) \prec f(\theta^k)(b) \}$$
We call the candidate $x_{b|a}$ our "pivot" from $a$ to $b$.  Note $b|a$ is _unique_ despite our particular choice of $\theta^0,\theta^1...,\theta^n$ since $f$ satisfies binary independence. 

Additionally, if $\theta \in \mathcal{O}^n$ is a preference profile so that $\forall i \in [1, b|a)$:
$$\theta_i(a) \succ \theta_i(b)$$
and $\forall i \in (b|a,n]$:
$$\theta_i(a) \prec \theta_i(b)$$
then by construction:
$$f(\theta)(b) \succ f(\theta)(a) \iff \theta_{b|a}(b) \succ \theta_{b|a}(a)$$

#### The Power of Pivots
Let's introduce a third candidate $y_c$ and suppose we have a preference profile $\tau \in \mathcal{O}^n$ so that  $\forall i \in [1, b|a]$:
$$\tau_i(a) \succ \tau_i(b) \succ \tau_i(c) $$
, and $\forall i \in (b|a,n]$:
$$\tau_i(a) \prec \tau_i(c) \prec \tau_i(b)$$
Since $b|a$ is the pivot from $a$ to $b$, we know that:
$$f(\tau)(a) \succ f(\tau)(b)$$
Also by unanimity:
$$f(\tau)(b) \succ f(\tau)(c)$$
Thus:
$$f(\tau)(a) \succ f(\tau)(b) \succ f(\tau)(c)$$
Now, if voter $x_{b|a}$ switches their order preference so:
$$\tau_{b|a}(b) \succ \tau_{b|a}(a) \succ \tau_{b|a}(c) $$
and the rest of the voters arbitrarily shuffle their preferences between $y_b$ and $y_c$, then binary independence implies we still have:
$$f(\tau)(a) \succ f(\tau)(c)$$
Moreover, since $b|a$ is the pivot from $a$ to $b$:
$$f(\tau)(b) \succ f(\tau)(a)$$
Thus:
$$f(\tau)(b) \succ f(\tau)(a) \succ f(\tau)(c)$$
Finally, if all the voters arbitrarily change their ranking of $y_a$, then binary independence implies we still have:
$$f(\tau)(b)  \succ f(\tau)(c)$$
Thus, so long as voter $x_{b|a}$ prefers candidate $y_b$ to $y_c$, this dictates $f(\tau)(b) \succ f(\tau)(c)$, _regardless of everyone else's preferences_. 

In other words the pivot from $a$ to $b$ gets to force all candidates (except for $y_a$) below $y_b$ in the aggregate preference if they so chose. Interesting, nâ€™est ce pas? 

#### All Pivots are the Same

Consider a preference profile $\theta \in \mathcal{O}^n$ such that $\forall i \in [1,b|a)$:
$$\theta_i(b) \succ \theta_i(c)$$
and $\forall i \in (b|a,n]$:
$$\theta_i(c) \succ \theta_i(b)$$
As we saw at the end of the last section, since $\theta_{b|a}(b) \succ \theta_{b|a}(c)$ we must have:
$$f(\theta)(b) \succ f(\theta)(c)$$
Thus $b|c \leq b|a$.

Now consider a preference profile $\theta \in \mathcal{O}^n$ such that $\forall i \in [1,b|a)$:
$$\theta_i(c) \succ \theta_i(b)$$
and $\forall i \in [b|a,n]$:
$$\theta_i(b) \succ \theta_i(c)$$
As we saw at the end of the last section, since $\theta_{b|a}(b) \succ \theta_{b|a}(c)$ we must have:
$$f(\theta)(b) \succ f(\theta)(c)$$
Thus $c|b \geq b|a$. Putting this together with the previous inequality:
$$b|c \leq b|a \leq c|b$$
By symmetry we have:
$$c|b \leq c|a \leq b|c$$
Thus:
$$b|c=c|b=a|b=b|a=c|a=a|c$$
Since all pivots are the same, there exists a voter who gets to force each candidate below any other candidate in the aggregate preference. Thus this voter is a dictor, contradicting our assumption that $f$ is non-dictatorial!
